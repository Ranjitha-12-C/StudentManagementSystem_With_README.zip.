# 🎓 Student Management System

## 📘 Overview
This is a Java console-based application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It enables users to manage student data with persistent storage using file serialization. It’s designed with modular code structure and makes use of Java Collections for efficient data handling.

## ✨ Features
- Add, remove, update, and search student records by ID
- Input validation (e.g., unique IDs, valid age)
- Persistent file storage using `.dat` serialization
- Sorted listing of students
- Utilizes:
  - `ArrayList` for storage
  - `HashMap` for quick lookup
  - `TreeSet` for sorted data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java 8 or above
- Java Collections Framework
- File I/O and Object Serialization

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile all `.java` files:
   ```bash
   javac Student.java StudentManager.java StudentManagementSystem.java
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java StudentManagementSystem
   ```
